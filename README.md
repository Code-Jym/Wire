# Wire

Python strings, they are very simple and powerful ways of storing data. However, there are just some things strings just *can't* do.

With **Wire**, you can do all that.
Creating a simple Wire is as easy as this:

```python
from wire import Wire
wire = Wire("I am a wire, stronger than a string")
```

## Installation

The Installation is a simple as:

```bash
pip install wire
```

With a simple interface and powerful management tools. Strings will be a thing of the past.

## Notes

- All the return values for Wire are string objects (except for the ones getting a numerical value)
- This has not been tested on Non-Linux Operating Systems
- This is a basic re-implementation of string
