# Wire

Python strings, they are very simple and powerful ways of storing data. However, there are just some things strings just *can't* do.


With **Wire**, you can do all that.
Creating a simple Wire is as easy as this:

```python
from wire import Wire
wire = Wire("I am a wire, stronger than a string")
```
## Installation
```
pip install wire
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/Code-Jym/wire.git
cd wire
./setup.sh
```
