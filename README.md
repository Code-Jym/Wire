# Wire

Python strings, they are very simple and powerful ways of storing data. However, there are just some things strings just *cant* do.

With **Wire**, you can do all that.
Creating a simple Wire is as easy as this:

```python
from Wire import Wire
wire = Wire("I am a wire, stronger than a string")
```
