Description: # Wire
        
        Python strings, they are very simple and powerful ways of storing data. However, there are just some things strings just *can't* do.
        
        With **Wire**, you can do all that.
        Creating a simple Wire is as easy as this:
        
        ```python
        from wire import Wire
        wire = Wire("I am a wire, stronger than a string")
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        The Installation is a simple as:
        
        ```bash
        pip install wire
        ```
        
        With a simple interface and powerful management tools. Strings will be a thing of the past.

        ## Notes
        
        - All the return values for Wire are string objects (except for the ones getting a numerical value)
        - This has not been tested on Non-Linux Operating Systems
        - This is a basic re-implementation of string
